# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What is an instance variable in Ruby? How is it different from other variables?

  Your answer:

2. What is a block in Ruby?

4. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:
  OOP - Programming philosophy that relies on classes and objects, readable and structured code
  1) encapsulation - object keeps its own data/behavior
  2) polymorphism - child classes can implement their own their own methods/data
  3) inheritance - reuse common logic, passing info from parent to child
  4) abstraction - hiding internal information

  Functional programming - pure functions, given input will always produce the same output

3. CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete - basic actions a dev would want to perform

4. ORM: Object relation mapping, converting data between two incompatible languages in OOP
